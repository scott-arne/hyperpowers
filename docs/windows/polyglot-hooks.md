# Cross-Platform Polyglot Hooks for Claude Code

Claude Code plugins need hooks that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This document describes the single generic dispatcher pattern used in `hooks/run-hook.cmd`.

> **Authoritative source:** `hooks/run-hook.cmd` is the canonical implementation. When this document and the code diverge, trust the code.

## The Problem

Claude Code runs hook commands through a shell:
- **macOS/Linux**: bash or sh
- **Windows with Git Bash installed**: Git Bash
- **Windows without Git Bash**: PowerShell (older versions used CMD.exe)

Neither Windows fallback shell can parse our command string: PowerShell treats
a leading quoted path as a string expression and errors on the next bareword,
and CMD.exe's `/c` quoting rules strip the outer quotes when the path contains
a metacharacter such as `(`. Our hooks therefore declare `"shell": "bash"`
(supported since Claude Code 2.1.81; older versions ignore the key), which
forces the Git Bash route and, when Git Bash is absent, produces an actionable
"install Git for Windows" error instead of a shell parser failure.

This creates several challenges:

1. **Script execution**: Windows CMD can't execute `.sh` files directly
2. **Path format**: Windows uses backslashes (`C:\path`), Unix uses forward slashes (`/path`)
3. **Environment variables**: `$VAR` syntax doesn't work in CMD
4. **`.sh` auto-prepend**: Claude Code on Windows automatically prepends `bash` to any command that contains `.sh` in its path — this interferes with the dispatcher if scripts have extensions

## The Solution: Extensionless Scripts + Single Generic Dispatcher

The repo uses one generic `run-hook.cmd` dispatcher for all hooks. Hook scripts are **extensionless** (`session-start`, not `session-start.sh`). This is deliberate: it prevents Claude Code's Windows auto-detection from prepending `bash` to the dispatcher command and breaking it.

### File Structure

```
hooks/
├── hooks.json          # Points to run-hook.cmd with extensionless script name
├── run-hook.cmd        # Cross-platform dispatcher (the polyglot wrapper)
└── session-start       # Actual hook logic — extensionless bash script
```

### hooks.json

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|clear|compact",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run-hook.cmd\" session-start",
            "shell": "bash",
            "async": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The path is quoted because `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` may contain spaces.

## How `run-hook.cmd` Works at a High Level

`run-hook.cmd` is a polyglot script. It opens with four `:;` label lines:
`cmd.exe` skips a line beginning with `:` as a label and runs the batch block;
a POSIX shell runs `:` as a no-op, evaluates the rest of each line, and `exec`s
bash on the named hook before reaching any batch text.

Do not copy an implementation from this document. Read `hooks/run-hook.cmd`
directly when changing the dispatcher, and run `tests/hooks/test-session-start.sh`
afterward.

### How it works on Windows (CMD.exe)

1. The batch section validates the script name and resolves the hook directory
   from the dispatcher's own location.
2. It tries bash in three places:
   - `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\bash.exe`
   - `bash` on `PATH` (MSYS2, Cygwin, or a non-default Git install)
3. If bash is found, it runs the named extensionless hook script from the hooks
   directory.
4. If no bash is found, the dispatcher exits `0` silently — the plugin
   continues working, it just skips the hook.
5. `exit /b` stops CMD before it reaches the Unix section.

### How it works on Unix (bash/sh)

The wrapper opens with four `:;` label lines:

```
:; command -v bash >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0
:; [ $# -ge 1 ] || exit 0
:; SCRIPT_DIR="$(CDPATH= cd -- "$(dirname -- "$0")" && pwd)"
:; SCRIPT_NAME="$1"; shift; exec bash "${SCRIPT_DIR}/${SCRIPT_NAME}" "$@"
```

`cmd.exe` reads a line beginning with `:` as a label and skips it, so Windows
falls straight through to the `@echo off` batch block. A POSIX shell runs `:`
as a no-op, evaluates the rest of each line, and `exec`s bash on the named
hook before it ever reaches the batch text.

This replaced an earlier `: << 'CMDBLOCK'` heredoc that wrapped the batch
block. bash 5.1 and newer write a heredoc into a pipe before forking; under
macOS pipe pressure the kernel hands out 512-byte pipes and the wrapper's
1.4 KB block deadlocked every hook
([obra/superpowers#571](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/571)).
Heredocs are now banned throughout `hooks/`, with
`tests/hooks/test-no-heredocs-in-hooks.sh` as the fence.

Both missing-bash and missing-script-name exit 0 silently. Hooks supply
optional context; a wrapper that errors is worse than one that says nothing.

### Key design decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Extensionless scripts | Prevents Claude Code's Windows `.sh`-auto-prepend from interfering with the dispatcher command |
| No `-l` (login shell) | Not needed; hook scripts should be self-contained and not depend on login-shell PATH setup |
| No `cygpath` | Bash receives the Windows path directly and handles it correctly; `cygpath` was needed by the old `-c "..."` invocation pattern, not by direct exec |
| Silent exit on no-bash | Avoids breaking the plugin for users who don't have Git for Windows; hook context injection is skipped gracefully |

## Writing Cross-Platform Hook Scripts

Your hook logic goes in the extensionless script file. A few portable patterns:

### Do
- Use pure bash builtins when possible
- Use `$(command)` instead of backticks
- Quote all variable expansions: `"$VAR"`

### Avoid
- Relying on PATH-dependent tools without fallbacks (the hook runs without `-l`, so login-shell PATH is not set)
- Giving scripts a `.sh` extension — this triggers Claude Code's Windows auto-prepend

### Example: JSON escaping without external tools

```bash
escape_for_json() {
    local input="$1"
    local output=""
    local i char
    for (( i=0; i<${#input}; i++ )); do
        char="${input:$i:1}"
        case "$char" in
            $'\\') output+='\\' ;;
            '"') output+='\"' ;;
            $'\n') output+='\n' ;;
            $'\r') output+='\r' ;;
            $'\t') output+='\t' ;;
            *) output+="$char" ;;
        esac
    done
    printf '%s' "$output"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "bash is not recognized"

CMD couldn't find bash in any of the three locations the dispatcher tries. The dispatcher exits silently (0) rather than erroring, so the hook is skipped. Install Git for Windows at the standard path or ensure `bash` is on `PATH`.

### Hook runs on Unix but does nothing on Windows

Check that the script filename is **extensionless** in `hooks.json`. A command like `run-hook.cmd session-start.sh` can trigger Claude Code's `.sh` auto-detection and bypass the intended CMD dispatcher path, or just try to run a non-existent `session-start.sh` script.

### Hook doesn't fire at all

Verify the `matcher` in `hooks.json` matches the event type your harness emits. Claude Code uses `startup|clear|compact`; Cursor uses `sessionStart`. Check `hooks-cursor.json` for the Cursor variant; this fork also ships `hooks-codex.json` with `startup|clear|compact` for the Codex integration.
